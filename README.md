# Tips



### Points to note before starting preparation:
- Read and understand the ACE study guide


- Target: If you are really committed to giving the exam then make sure you go and book your slot as early as possible because unless you do that you will not study efficiently or feel you are not prepared and maybe start procrastinating.



### How to prepare:    
- Take notes so that you’ll remember them.

- Hands On: Don’t forget to do the hands-on practice as it will become easier for you to answer the questions.

- Use networking groups (Reddit, Slack, Discord) to get input from others who have passed it.  

- Cost optimization is a big part in testing, so know how to read a complex scenario and then pick the most cost-efficient solution that hits the objectives.   

- Build a list of online cheat sheets. Note good articles that provide additional context.

- Spent sufficient amount of time practicing gcloud commands.

- Get into Google Cloud Platform and build something! There’s nothing better than real-world experience, and Google makes it really easy to get in and use the platform for free.
 
- Play around with the GCP Pricing Calculator.


### How to study one week before the exam

- Take the [Associate Cloud Engineer practice exam](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfexWKtXT2OSFJ-obA4iT3GmzgiOCGvjrT9OfxilWC1yPtmfQ/viewform) one week before the Certification exam. So, you can analyze your knowledge and check where you stand.

- Brush up the topics which you’re not sure before the exam.

- Revise the GCP services with the help of Google Cloud Cheat Sheet and self made notes.

### How to start the exam on exam day
- Your surroundings will be inspected. It should be free from clutter or any incriminating materials. It’s you, your computer, and the remote proctor who has access to your webcam and microphone. They can see and hear you for all 2 hours of the exam.


1. Ten minutes prior to the exam time, log in into your [Webassessor account](https://www.webassessor.com/wa.do?page=publicHome&branding=GOOGLECLOUD)

2. Go to [assessment page.](https://www.webassessor.com/wa.do?page=CANDIDATE&tabs=10)

3. Install the latest secure browser then run and install the program.

4. Create your Biometric Profile.

### How to attempt the question
- Read entire question once/twice  

- Review it carefully since a single word can make the difference

### During the exam
- Before submitting the test make sure you review all selected options once again.  

- There might be a scenario where two options are really close to each other both of them may seem correct then, in that case, read the question 2–3 times find out what differentiates the two options and select the appropriate one.  

### After the Exam

- Google doesnt give scorecard. Certificate is sent on mail within 10 days after the exam.
